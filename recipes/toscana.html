    <h2>Simple, common ingredients, yet outstanding results!</h2>

    <p>Looking for a simple soup that is hearty and (somewhat) healthy? Give this one a try! Reduce your kitchen clutter by cooking everything in the Instant Pot.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 
    <ul>
        <li>5 strips bacon (thick cut works best) cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 17.6 ounce pack Italian sausages crumbled</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>1 medium onion chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth (beef works too)</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>4 medium-to-large red potatoes roughly diced (leave skins on)</li>
        <li>1 dash Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy/whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 small bunch of kale torn into bite-size pieces (remove stems)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Using kitchen shears (or a knife), cut the bacon into small pieces and add it to your Instant Pot. Press the saut√© button and start frying the bacon (give it about a 5 minute head start before adding the sausages so it crisps up more).</li>
        <li>Take the sausage meat out of its casings (I make a cut in the casings then use my fingers to break the meat into bite-size pieces) and add it to the Instant Pot as you go along. Cook until the sausages and bacon are crispy and browned.</li>
        <li>While the sausages and bacon cook, chop the onion and potatoes, making sure to stir the bacon and sausages occasionally.</li>
        <li>When the sausages and bacon are nicely browned and crispy, stir in the garlic and onion and cook for about a minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the chicken broth and water. Scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the Instant Pot.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes and Italian seasoning.</li>
        <li>Give the soup a stir and close the Instant Pot's lid. Make sure the valve is set to "sealing".</li>
        <li>Press the "manual" button and set the timer for 8 minutes on high pressure. The Instant Pot will take about 10 minutes or so to come up to pressure.</li>
        <li>One the countdown has finished, carefully do a quick pressure release (it can splatter) and take off the lid.</li>
        <li>Add the cream and kale. Close the lid again and let the soup sit for another 5 minutes or so until the kale wilts (keep the Instant Pot off or on "keep warm").</li>
        <li>Season with salt & pepper as needed and enjoy immediately. </li>
    </ol>
